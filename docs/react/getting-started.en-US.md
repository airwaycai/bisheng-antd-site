Ant Design React is dedicated to providing a **good development experience** for programmers. Before starting, it is recommended to learn [React](https://reactjs.org) and [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) first, and correctly install and configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8 or above.

The official guide also assumes that you have intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and React. If you are just starting to learn front-end or React, it may not be the best idea to use the UI framework as your first step.

Finally, if you are working in a local development environment, please refer to [Install and Initialization](/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app#Install-and-Initialization) section of "Use in create-react-app".
